## Week 3: Wordpress CMS

### Learning Activities

In the third week of CMS, I spent most of my time, as I did last week, in learning a new platform. This time, it was Wordpress. I also set up an AWS EC2 instance, which I am using to host my Wordpress website. Luckily, I set up Wordpress in the first week of CMS, due a misunderstanding I had, but it ended up making this week a bit easier, as I did not have to mess around with setting up a new EC2 instance.

Just like last week, most of my learning was about Wordpress, how to use it and how the different components interact with each other. I found Wordpress to have a lot more features that I could use to make my website. It uses different *blocks* to structure the site, like headers, paragraphs, columns/rows and images. I also used a block for writing custom HTML code, as some things were just easier that way when it came to migrating the content to Wordpress.

I am not sure where to mention it, but I also installed 2 plugins for Wordpress, one for generating a pricing table, and one for generating a contact form.

### Estimated Hours

Total 10 hours, where 4 hours were spent setting up AWS, EC2 and Wordpress, 2 hours spent actually learning Wordpress, and the remaining time spent migrating and cleaning up on the new Wordpress site.

### Content Insights

As with Joomla last week, it was quite interesting to learn Wordpress. I felt the same when it came to making web development easier, but this time even more so with all the different blocks that could be used. I would say, if I had to pick one, I would choose Wordpress over Joomla, as it just is better in my eyes. It is more flexible, making it better in a broader spectrum of cases.

This time around, the amount of HTML code that I could write was a bit more limited, so it took more time and effort to migrate my site to Wordpress, and I had to learn to use the different blocks rather than just using pure HTML. There is, however always an option to use custom CSS classes for styling, which made it a bit easier to get it to look the same as my Joomla and GH Pages sites.

The web hosting aspect of it was also interesting. Setting up the EC2 instance took some effort, but I was relieved to see that it was essentially just a linux server, which I have some experience with.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The Wordpress site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that I set up. I am certain that knowing this platform and technology will come in handy in the future. Knowing my way around AWS will prove to be important in my future job. Furthermore, Wordpress is widely used, around 43% of all website use it, so I believe it will be important to know this platform.

As I wrote last week, "*knowing yet another platform that is used for web development is good, not only because I learn a new skill, but it also improves my ability to learn and grasp new technologies and platforms further.*" Having to learn 3 different platforms/technologies in 3 weeks, not to mention 3 different site hosting solutions, has been difficult, yet I feel that I learn a little faster every time. With technology ever-evolving, being able to learn new platforms and technologies fast will be extremely helpful in my future, not only for university, but also for "real-life" jobs.
