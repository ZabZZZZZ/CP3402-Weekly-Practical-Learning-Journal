## Week 4: Local Development Environment

### Learning Activities

In the fourth week of CMS, I spent my time in two areas. The first area was further developing the sites and adding more features, as well as fine-tuning and making small changes to the design. I studied the assignment guide more closely, and I decided to change the "Our Experts" page to "Our Team". Reason being, that I could add more team members, while still keeping the "experts", without having to make another tab.

The second area was creating a local development environment. The point of doing this is, that it enables me to make changes locally and test them before publishing a "final" version of all the changes to the live public site, also known as the "production" environment.

I also managed to make a "custom" url for the sites, as can be seen on the screenshots below:

After all this, I have installed 6 plugins, 3 for Joomla and 3 for Wordpress.

### Content Insights

Adding more content to my sites was quite easy. I have spent a good amount of time learning the two platforms, so I knew my way around them, as well as how to deal with the quirks of each platform. For example, some things that just worked as HTML in Joomla did not work the same in Wordpress, so I had to use certain "blocks" provided by Wordpress to make it look similar.

Making a local development environment was one of the major parts that I spent time with this week. This part was not too painful for Joomla, as there is a plugin that makes this easy. There was only one problem, and it was due to how I first set up Joomla locally, then moved it to a cloud server for hosting, by just copy/pasting the files. This resulted in two directories that should not have been there, but the problem was solved by simply just deleting them from the server.

After making a local development environment for Joomla, I proceeded to do the same for Wordpress. Again, there was a plugin that made this extremely easy, the only part that took any time was making a local Wordpress site before importing the site from the cloud.

The plugins used for each site is an equivalent of each other. For example, I used a plugin to make a contact form for the contact us page on both Joomla and Wordpress. This makes it very easy to leave some tedious parts to the plugins, while I can focus on the content of the sites, as well as the design.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

When setting up the local development environment for Joomla and Wordpress, I used an application called XAMPP. It contains multiple applications in one, but the most important were Apache, PhpMyAdmin, and MariaDB. These were important in setting up the sites locally, and I could use just one XAMPP application to host both of my sites locally. I also went a step further, and gave custom domains to my local sites, which not only makes it easier to get to the websites, it also feels really cool.

I believe, that having a development pipeline is necessary to having a smooth development cycle. Going from making changes to the local environment, to pushing them to production is one thing that happens in almost every company, so knowing how to set up the local development environment will definitely be important in a career context.
