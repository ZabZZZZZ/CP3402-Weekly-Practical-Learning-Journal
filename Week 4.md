## Week 4: Local Development Environment

### Learning Activities

In the fourth week of CMS, I spent my time in two areas. The first area was further developing the sites and adding more features, as well as fine-tuning and making small changes to the design. I studied the assignment guide more closely, and I decided to change the "Our Experts" page to "Our Team". Reason being, that I could add more team members, while still keeping the "experts", without having to make another tab.

The second area was creating a local development environment. The point of doing this is, that it enables me to make changes locally and test them before publishing a "final" version of all the changes to the live public site, also known as the "production" environment. This part was not too painful for Joomla, as there is a plugin that makes this easy. There was only one problem, and it was due to how I first set up Joomla locally, then moved it to a cloud server for hosting, by just copy/pasting the files. This resulted in two directories that should not have been there, but the problem was solved by just deleting them from the server.

I also managed to make a "custom" url for the sites, as can be seen on the screenshots below:

After all this, I have installed 5 plugins, 3 for Joomla and 2 for Wordpress.

### Estimated Hours

2 hours for Joomla local env

Total 10 hours, where 4 hours were spent setting up AWS, EC2 and Wordpress, 2 hours spent actually learning Wordpress, and the remaining time spent migrating and cleaning up on the new Wordpress site.

### Content Insights

As with Joomla last week, it was quite interesting to learn Wordpress. I felt the same when it came to making web development easier, but this time even more so with all the different blocks that could be used. I would say, if I had to pick one, I would choose Wordpress over Joomla, as it just is better in my eyes. It is more flexible, making it better in a broader spectrum of cases.

This time around, the amount of HTML code that I could write was a bit more limited, so it took more time and effort to migrate my site to Wordpress, and I had to learn to use the different blocks rather than just using pure HTML. There is, however always an option to use custom CSS classes for styling, which made it a bit easier to get it to look the same as my Joomla and GH Pages sites.

The web hosting aspect of it was also interesting. Setting up the EC2 instance took some effort, but I was relieved to see that it was essentially just a linux server, which I have some experience with.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The Wordpress site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that I set up. I am certain that knowing this platform and technology will come in handy in the future. Knowing my way around AWS will prove to be important in my future job. Furthermore, Wordpress is widely used, around 43% of all website use it, so I believe it will be important to know this platform.

As I wrote last week, "*knowing yet another platform that is used for web development is good, not only because I learn a new skill, but it also improves my ability to learn and grasp new technologies and platforms further.*" Having to learn 3 different platforms/technologies in 3 weeks, not to mention 3 different site hosting solutions, has been difficult, yet I feel that I learn a little faster every time. With technology ever-evolving, being able to learn new platforms and technologies fast will be extremely helpful in my future, not only for university, but also for "real-life" jobs.
