If i am using wordpress.org on my aws hosted server, how can i add my own css stylesheet? Also does wordpress support bootstrap?
ChatGPT said:

Great questions! Let’s break it down:
1. Adding your own CSS stylesheet in WordPress.org (self-hosted on AWS)

Since you’re hosting WordPress yourself, you have full control. There are a few ways to add your custom CSS:
Option A: Add via Theme’s functions.php

This is the recommended method if you want to enqueue your own stylesheet properly:

    Go to your theme folder:
    /wp-content/themes/your-theme/

    Open functions.php

    Add this snippet:

    function my_custom_styles() {
        wp_enqueue_style(
            'my-custom-style',
            get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/css/custom.css'
        );
    }
    add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_custom_styles');

    Create a css/custom.css file in your theme folder and put your CSS there.

✅ This ensures WordPress loads it properly without breaking updates.
Option B: Use the Theme Customizer

    In WordPress admin, go to:
    Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS

    Paste your CSS directly.
    (This is fine for small tweaks, but not ideal for large stylesheets.)

Option C: Child Theme (Best if modifying an existing theme)

    Create a child theme (so your changes aren’t lost when the parent theme updates).

    Add your stylesheet inside the child theme and enqueue it like in Option A.

Option D: Using a Plugin

    Plugins like Simple Custom CSS or Code Snippets let you add CSS without editing theme files.

2. Does WordPress support Bootstrap?

    Yes, absolutely. WordPress doesn’t include Bootstrap by default, but you can load it just like any other CSS/JS library.

    Add Bootstrap in your theme’s functions.php:

    function my_bootstrap_enqueue() {
        // Bootstrap CSS
        wp_enqueue_style('bootstrap-css', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css');
        
        // Bootstrap JS
        wp_enqueue_script('bootstrap-js', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js', array('jquery'), null, true);
    }
    add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_bootstrap_enqueue');

    Then you can use Bootstrap classes inside your theme templates or in the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg).

✅ Summary:

    You can add your stylesheet via functions.php, Customizer, child theme, or plugin.

    WordPress supports Bootstrap (or any framework) as long as you enqueue it properly.

Do you want me to show you step-by-step how to set up a child theme (so you can safely add both your custom CSS and Bootstrap without breaking updates)?
You said:
Where can i find the functions.php? Also how would i do it if aws wasnt available, hypothetically?
ChatGPT said:

Good follow-up 👌 Let’s go step by step.
🔎 Where to find functions.php in WordPress.org (self-hosted on AWS)

Since you’re hosting WordPress on AWS, the file structure is the same as anywhere else:

    Default location of functions.php:

    /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/your-active-theme/functions.php

        your-active-theme = the folder of the theme you’re currently using (e.g., twentytwentyfive, astra, etc.).

    Ways to access it:

        SSH/SFTP into your AWS server → Navigate to that directory and open it with a text editor (nano, vim, or download via SFTP).

        WordPress Admin Dashboard →
        Go to Appearance → Theme File Editor → Select functions.php from the right-hand side.
        ⚠️ This works, but be careful—editing in the dashboard can break your site if you paste code wrong.

        AWS Management Console (EC2 / Lightsail) → If using Lightsail, you can connect via the built-in SSH terminal.

🖥️ If AWS wasn’t available (hypothetically)

If you were running WordPress elsewhere (local or another host), the process is the same:

    Local development (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, LocalWP):

        Your WordPress root is inside your local server folder (like htdocs/wordpress/).

        Path is still:

        wordpress/wp-content/themes/your-active-theme/functions.php

    Shared hosting (e.g., Bluehost, SiteGround):

        Log into cPanel → File Manager → Navigate to
        /public_html/wp-content/themes/your-theme/

        There you’ll find functions.php.

    Other cloud hosting (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.):

        Similar to AWS → SSH into your server → Navigate to the WordPress installation path → edit functions.php.

✅ So the method doesn’t depend on AWS. WordPress always keeps themes inside:

wp-content/themes/your-theme/

👉 Would you like me to also show you how to set up a child theme so you don’t have to touch the main theme’s functions.php (safer for updates)?
You said:
I launched an EC2 instance, where wordpress is set up. I can see the site is up and running, and i can even edit the site on my browser. However, when i log in to AWS, i cannot see the instance. I am logged in as root user, which i am pretty sure is where i launched the EC2 instance. Any idea why it is not showing up?
ChatGPT said:

Got it — this is a pretty common situation with AWS beginners 👇

If your WordPress site is up and running, but you don’t see the EC2 instance in the AWS Management Console, here are the main reasons why that can happen:
1. Wrong AWS Region

    EC2 instances are region-specific.

    For example, if you launched your WordPress server in us-east-1 (N. Virginia), but your console is currently set to us-west-2 (Oregon), you won’t see it.

    Fix:

        In the AWS Console, look at the top-right corner where the region is shown.

        Switch to other regions until your instance appears.

2. Different AWS Account

    Sometimes people have multiple AWS accounts (personal, work, free-tier test, etc.) and log into the wrong one.

    Even if you’re logged in as “root user,” it has to be the same AWS account ID that you used to launch the instance.

    Fix:

        Check your account ID (top right in the console → "My Account").

        Compare it with the account you used when launching WordPress.

3. You might be looking in the wrong service

    If you used Lightsail instead of EC2 to launch WordPress (common for one-click installs), your instance won’t show up in EC2 — it will only show up in Lightsail.

    Fix: Go to AWS Console → Lightsail and check there.

4. Possible termination

    If you accidentally terminated the instance, the site would normally go down.

    Since your site is still up, this isn’t the case — but worth keeping in mind.

✅ Next Steps

    Log into AWS Console.

    Switch through regions in the dropdown (top-right).

    If still nothing, check Lightsail dashboard instead of EC2.

    Confirm you’re logged into the correct AWS account.

⚡ Quick question for you: when you originally launched WordPress, did you use the EC2 Launch Wizard (manual setup) or the WordPress one-click option (often Lightsail)?

That’ll tell us exactly where to look.
You said:
If i look at my browsing history, i can see that i was on ap-southeast-2, meaning my instance should be on that server (sydney), right?
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — you’ve nailed it 👌

If your browsing history shows you were on ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) when you launched the WordPress instance, then that’s the region where AWS created your EC2 (or Lightsail) server.

A few key points:

    EC2 is region-specific

        If you switch to another region in the AWS console, you won’t see your instance.

        Make sure your console is set to Sydney (ap-southeast-2).

        Top-right corner of the AWS console → Region dropdown → choose Asia Pacific (Sydney).

    Confirm if it’s EC2 or Lightsail

        AWS Marketplace’s WordPress "quick launch" often uses Lightsail, not EC2.

        If you check EC2 → Instances in ap-southeast-2 and still see nothing, go to Lightsail → Instances in the same region.

    Public site still working = instance is alive

        Since your WordPress site is up, the server is definitely running.

        It’s just a matter of finding whether it’s in EC2 or Lightsail.

🔎 So the plan is:

    Go to AWS Console

    Switch region → Asia Pacific (Sydney)

    Check both EC2 → Instances and Lightsail → Instances

👉 Do you remember if you clicked “EC2” when launching WordPress, or was it something like “Launch WordPress with 1-click”? That will tell me whether we’re looking in EC2 or Lightsail.
You said:
How can i make a top bar for my site, that links to other pages on the website?
ChatGPT said:

Nice — that’s a great next step for making your site look more professional 👍

In WordPress, a top bar with links to your pages is usually just a navigation menu placed in your theme’s header. Here are the main approaches:
1. Use WordPress Menus (No Code Needed)

This is the most common way.

    In your WordPress dashboard:

        Go to Appearance → Menus (or in newer versions, Appearance → Editor → Navigation).

        Create a new menu (e.g., “Top Menu”).

        Add links to pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact).

        Save it.

    Assign it to a location:

        Most themes have a "Primary Menu" or "Top Bar" location.

        Assign your menu to that location.

✅ Your theme will render it automatically at the top.
2. Using Widgets or Block Editor (Header area)

If your theme supports the block editor for headers:

    Go to Appearance → Editor (Site Editor).

    Click on the header area.

    Add a Navigation block.

    Choose or create your menu.

    Save changes.

3. Code It Manually (Custom Top Bar)

If you want more control and you’re comfortable editing theme files:

    Open your theme’s header.php (child theme recommended).

    Add a wp_nav_menu() call where you want the bar to appear:

<?php
wp_nav_menu(array(
    'theme_location' => 'top-bar-menu',
    'container'      => 'nav',
    'container_class'=> 'top-bar',
));
?>

In functions.php, register the menu:

function register_top_bar_menu() {
    register_nav_menu('top-bar-menu', __( 'Top Bar Menu' ));
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'register_top_bar_menu');

Add CSS to style it:

    .top-bar {
        background: #333;
        padding: 10px;
    }
    .top-bar a {
        color: white;
        margin: 0 15px;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
    .top-bar a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }

4. Use a Plugin (If Your Theme Lacks It)

Plugins like:

    Max Mega Menu

    WP Responsive Menu
    let you build and style navigation bars easily.

✅ Easiest path for you right now:
Go to Appearance → Menus, make a new menu, add your pages, and assign it to the header/top location.

👉 Do you want your top bar to be just links (like a simple navbar), or more like a sticky header with logo + navigation (Bootstrap style)?

<div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center">

How can i make it so that it stretches the whole screen?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see what’s happening 👍

Right now, your <div> has Bootstrap padding utilities (px-4 py-5 my-5) and a background (bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center), but Bootstrap by default makes content inside the page container. That’s why it doesn’t stretch across the whole screen.
✅ Two ways to fix it
1. Make the div full-width

Add the container-fluid or w-100 class:

<div class="w-100 px-4 py-5 my-5 bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center">
    <!-- Your content -->
</div>

    w-100 = forces the element to take 100% width of the screen.

    container-fluid = special Bootstrap class that makes the container span the full viewport width.

2. Remove any parent “container”

If this <div> is inside a .container or .row, it will be restricted to the grid width.
For true full width:

<div class="bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center py-5">
   <div class="container">
      <!-- Keep content aligned nicely here -->
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
   </div>
</div>

    Outer <div> = full-width background.

    Inner .container = keeps text/content centered with proper margins.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want the background color to stretch the whole width but keep the content centered, or should everything (background + text) span across the screen?

</div>
</div>

This is the code for one of my pages made in joomla. I have tried to paste this into wordpress as html, but it does not seem to stretch too far. How can i fix that?
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — thanks for sharing the exact code. This makes it clear.

The issue is that in WordPress, when you paste HTML into the editor, your code is usually wrapped inside a block container (like .wp-block-group or .wp-block-post-content) that has max-width and auto margins applied by the theme. That’s why your w-100 isn’t stretching across the entire screen — the parent container is restricting it.
✅ Fix Options
Option 1: Use "Full Width" Block Setting (Easiest)

    In the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg):

        Insert a Custom HTML block.

        Paste your code in there.

        In the block’s sidebar (right-hand panel), set Align → Full width.

This removes the default width restriction.
Option 2: Add a Full-Width Wrapper

Wrap your section in a wp-block-cover alignfull or add a custom CSS class that forces full width:

<div class="alignfull bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center py-5">
  <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">Get help to manage your very own Cabaret Club</h1>
  <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
    <p class="lead mb-4">If you have ever wanted to grow you Cabaret Club business to compete with the other great Cabaret Clubs, you have come to the right place. With the help of our experts, you can exponentially increase your customer base, as well as your revenue.</p>
    <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-sm-flex justify-content-sm-center">
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4" href="index.php/contact">Contact Us Now</a>
      <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-lg px-4 gap-3" href="index.php/our-experts">Learn More</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Then in your theme CSS (Customizer → Additional CSS):

.alignfull {
  width: 100vw;
  margin-left: calc(-50vw + 50%);
}

This forces the block to span the entire viewport.
Option 3: Edit Theme Container Width

If you want all content blocks to have the option of stretching full width:

    Many modern themes (like Block themes or Astra/GeneratePress) already support “Full Width” templates.

    Go to Page → Template → Full Width in the editor.

    Then your pasted HTML can take up the whole screen.

🔑 Key Point

The problem isn’t your Bootstrap code — it’s WordPress wrapping it inside a content container with max-width. To fix, you either:

    Use Align Full for the block, or

    Apply custom CSS to break out of the theme container.

👉 Do you want me to show you a ready-to-paste WordPress block version of your section (that will automatically stretch full width if your theme supports it)?

 bg-secondary bg-opacity-10

What color would this give in hex?
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👍

In Bootstrap 5, the classes you used break down like this:

    bg-secondary → sets the background color to Bootstrap’s secondary color.
    By default, Bootstrap’s secondary color is:

#6c757d

bg-opacity-10 → sets the alpha (opacity) of the background color to 10%.
So the final color is not a pure hex, but an RGBA value:

    rgba(108, 117, 125, 0.1)

✅ Interpreting It

    Base color: #6c757d (a grayish tone).

    With 10% opacity, it looks like a very light gray overlay.

    If you needed an approximate solid hex for design tools, it would depend on the background behind it (since opacity blends with what’s underneath).

👉 Do you want me to calculate the blended hex value as it would appear on a pure white background?

<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

If i want to apply those css classes to this block, how would i do that?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — now you’re working directly with WordPress block markup 👍

In the Block Editor (Gutenberg), each block can have extra CSS classes applied. That’s how you’d bring in your Bootstrap classes (bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center py-5, etc.).
✅ Two Ways to Add Classes
1. Using the Editor UI (Recommended)

    Select your Group block (the outer container in your example).

    On the right-hand sidebar → Block settings → Advanced → find the field called “Additional CSS class(es)”.

    Add your classes there, e.g.:

    bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 py-5 text-center

    Update → WordPress will append those classes to the block wrapper <div>.

Your code would then render like:

<div class="wp-block-group alignfull bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 py-5 text-center">
    <h1 class="wp-block-heading alignfull has-text-align-center"><strong>Get help to manage your very own Cabaret Club</strong></h1>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">If you have ever wanted to grow you Cabaret Club business ...</p>
</div>

2. Manually Editing the Markup (Code Editor Mode)

If you prefer to edit directly:

Change your Group <div> from:

<div class="wp-block-group alignfull">

to:

<div class="wp-block-group alignfull bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 py-5 text-center">

⚠️ Important

    This only works if Bootstrap CSS is loaded into your WordPress theme (since those are Bootstrap utility classes).

    If you haven’t enqueued Bootstrap yet, WordPress won’t recognize these classes, and nothing will change visually.

👉 Do you already have Bootstrap enqueued in your WordPress site, or should I show you the safe way to add it (so these classes actually work)?
You said:
I dont see the block settings on the right hand sidebar
ChatGPT said:

Ah, gotcha 👍 That’s a really common situation in the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg) — sometimes the sidebar with block settings isn’t visible.

Here’s how you can get it back and add your custom classes:
🔎 How to show the block settings sidebar

    In the editor, click anywhere inside the block you want to edit.

    If you don’t see a settings sidebar on the right:

        Press Shift + Ctrl + , (Windows/Linux) or Shift + Command + , (Mac) to toggle it.

        OR click the gear/settings icon ⚙️ at the top-right of the editor to open the sidebar.

    With your block selected, you’ll see two tabs: Page and Block.

        Click Block.

        Scroll down until you see Advanced → “Additional CSS class(es)”.

🛠️ Adding CSS classes

    In that field, type:

    bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 py-5 text-center

    Save/Update the page.

    WordPress will add those classes to your block’s <div>.

✨ If the sidebar still won’t appear

    You can always switch the editor into Code Editor mode:

        Click the 3 dots menu (⋮) in the top-right → Code Editor.

        Then manually add your classes to the block markup, like this:

    <div class="wp-block-group alignfull bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 py-5 text-center">

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to make sure Bootstrap CSS is loaded globally in your theme, so those bg-* classes actually work?
You said:
How can i make it so that the title does not appear on the page
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want your WordPress page title (the one that usually appears at the top of the page automatically) not to display, but still keep the content. There are several ways to do this depending on your setup:
1. Using the Page Editor (No Code)

Some WordPress themes have an option per page:

    Edit the page in the block editor.

    In the right-hand sidebar, under Page → Page Settings, look for:

        “Hide Title”

        “Display Title” toggle

    Turn it off and update the page.

✅ This is the simplest way if your theme supports it.
2. Using a “Hidden” CSS Class

If your theme doesn’t provide a toggle, you can hide it with CSS:

    Find the CSS class or ID for the page title. Usually it’s something like:

<h1 class="entry-title">Page Title</h1>

Add custom CSS in Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS:

    .entry-title {
        display: none;
    }

    Save → The title will be hidden on all pages using that class.

💡 If you want to hide it only on a specific page, use the page-specific body class WordPress generates. For example:

.page-id-123 .entry-title {
    display: none;
}

    Replace 123 with your page ID (check the body tag in browser inspector).

3. Using a Full-Width Template / Page Builder

    Some themes (especially block-based or builder-friendly ones) have “Blank” or “Full Width” templates that don’t render the page title automatically.

    To use it:
    Edit Page → Page Attributes → Template → Full Width / Blank.

✅ Quick Summary

    Theme option → toggle off “Display Title”

    CSS → hide .entry-title globally or per-page

    Template → use a blank/full-width template that doesn’t output the title

If you want, I can show you the exact CSS snippet that hides the page title for just that WordPress page while keeping everything else intact.

Do you want me to do that?

The uploaded file could not be moved to wp-content/uploads/2025/10.

When i try to upload an image, i get this error. What does it mean?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that error is very common on self-hosted WordPress sites, especially on AWS EC2 or other Linux servers. Let’s break it down carefully.
What the error means

    The uploaded file could not be moved to wp-content/uploads/2025/10.

This happens because WordPress cannot write files to the uploads folder. Essentially, it doesn’t have permission to create or move files into that directory.

Possible causes:

    Directory does not exist

        WordPress tries to upload to wp-content/uploads/2025/10 (year/month structure).

        If the 2025 or 10 folder doesn’t exist, WordPress tries to create it — but fails if permissions are wrong.

    Incorrect file/folder permissions

        On Linux servers, WordPress (running as the web server user, e.g., www-data on Ubuntu) needs write permissions on wp-content/uploads.

    Ownership mismatch

        If the folder is owned by root (or another user) but WordPress runs as www-data, it won’t be able to move files there.

How to fix it

Assuming your WordPress is on a Linux EC2 instance:
Step 1: Connect via SSH

ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip

(Change ubuntu if you’re using a different AMI username.)
Step 2: Navigate to your uploads folder

cd /var/www/html/wp-content

or wherever your WordPress is installed.
Step 3: Check if the uploads folder exists

ls -l

    You should see uploads in the list.

    If it’s missing, create it:

mkdir uploads

Step 4: Set correct ownership

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data uploads

    Replace www-data with your web server user if different (apache on Amazon Linux).

Step 5: Set proper permissions

sudo find uploads -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find uploads -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

    Directories: 755 → readable and executable by everyone, writable by owner

    Files: 644 → readable by everyone, writable by owner

Step 6: Test

    Go back to WordPress → try uploading an image.

    It should work now.

✅ Quick Recap

    The error is caused by permission or ownership issues on wp-content/uploads.

    Fix it by:

        Ensuring the folder exists.

        Setting the web server as the owner.

        Setting proper folder/file permissions.

If you want, I can give you a one-liner command that fixes all uploads folder permissions recursively safely on AWS EC2 for WordPress — it’s faster than doing each step manually.

Do you want me to do that?
You said:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-23-149 wp-content]$ sudo chown apache:apache uploads
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-23-149 wp-content]$ sudo find uploads -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find uploads -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-23-149 wp-content]$ ls
index.php  plugins  themes  uploads

I did this, and it still cannot upload
ChatGPT said:

Ah, thanks for sharing the exact commands and output — that helps narrow it down. Since you’re on an EC2 instance with ec2-user and you set the owner to apache:apache, there are a few possibilities why WordPress still can’t write to uploads:
1. Check the Web Server User

    On Amazon Linux / EC2, the web server might be running as a different user than apache.

Run:

ps aux | grep httpd

or, if using Amazon Linux 2 with Apache:

ps aux | grep apache

    Look at the user in the left column.

    On some AMIs, the user is www-data, apache, or nginx (if using Nginx).

If the web server runs as www-data, your folder must be owned by www-data:www-data.
2. Check SELinux or ACL restrictions

    On Amazon Linux, SELinux is usually disabled, but if enabled, it can prevent writes even if permissions look correct.

    You can check:

getenforce

    If it returns Enforcing, you’ll need to adjust SELinux context:

sudo chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t uploads

3. Check folder permissions recursively

    Even though you ran chmod 755 on directories, double-check:

ls -ld uploads
ls -l uploads

    The uploads folder itself must be writable by the web server user:

chmod 775 uploads

    If apache (or the web server user) is in the group owning the folder, 775 ensures write access.

4. Temporary fix for testing

sudo chmod -R 777 uploads

    If this works, it confirms it’s a permissions/ownership issue.

    Do not leave 777 in production — it’s insecure.

    Fix: revert to proper ownership and 755/775 permissions once you confirm it works.

5. Check PHP’s upload_tmp_dir

    Sometimes WordPress cannot move files because PHP cannot write to its temporary directory.

    Check php.ini for:

upload_tmp_dir

    Ensure that folder exists and is writable by the web server.

⚡ Next Step I Recommend
Run these commands to confirm the web server user and adjust ownership accordingly:

ps aux | grep httpd
sudo chown -R apache:apache uploads
sudo chmod -R 775 uploads

Then try uploading again.

If you want, I can write the exact one-liner sequence that fixes uploads folder on Amazon Linux for WordPress, taking into account ownership, permissions, and common pitfalls.

Perfect — this tells us the web server user is apache, so your previous chown apache:apache uploads was correct. That rules out ownership mismatch.

Since the error persists, the problem is likely permissions or missing subfolders.
Step 1: Make sure year/month folders exist

WordPress tries to upload to:

wp-content/uploads/2025/10

Check if they exist:

ls -l uploads
ls -l uploads/2025

    If the folders don’t exist, WordPress tries to create them and fails.

    You can create them manually for testing:

mkdir -p uploads/2025/10
sudo chown -R apache:apache uploads/2025
sudo chmod -R 775 uploads/2025

Step 2: Set correct permissions recursively

To be safe, allow Apache to write to all current and future folders under uploads:

sudo find uploads -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
sudo find uploads -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;

    Directories: 775 → owner & group can write, others can read/execute

    Files: 664 → owner & group can write, others can read

Step 3: Test uploading

    Go back to WordPress → try uploading an image again.

    If it works now, everything is fixed.

Optional: Temporary debug

If it still fails, temporarily set uploads writable by everyone to confirm it’s permissions:

sudo chmod -R 777 uploads

    Upload should succeed → confirms a permissions problem.

    Immediately revert to 775 afterwards to avoid security risks.

💡 Most common cause on EC2: WordPress cannot create the year/month folder in uploads because the parent folder didn’t have group write access.

After these steps, uploads should work.

If you want, I can give you a one-liner command that ensures the uploads folder is fully ready for WordPress, including future months. This is the cleanest approach. Do you want me to do that?

What do these classes translate into in wordpress?
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you’re asking how Bootstrap classes like display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3 map when used in WordPress, particularly in the block editor. Let’s break each class down and how it behaves in WordPress:
Original HTML

<h1 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">Goro Majima</h1>

Bootstrap Class Breakdown
Class	Meaning
display-5	A large, prominent heading size (Bootstrap’s display headings). Typically bigger than normal h1-h6 but smaller than display-1 through display-4.
fw-bold	Font weight bold (font-weight: 700). Makes the text bold.
lh-1	Line height = 1 (line-height: 1). Makes the text more compact vertically.
mb-3	Margin-bottom = 1rem (Bootstrap spacing utility). Adds spacing below the heading.
How it works in WordPress

    Block editor (Gutenberg)

        You can add these classes directly:

            Select your heading block → Block → Advanced → Additional CSS Class(es) → type:

    display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3

WordPress will render it exactly like your HTML:

    <h1 class="wp-block-heading display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">Goro Majima</h1>

    Note: For this to actually style the text, Bootstrap CSS must be loaded in your theme.

Without Bootstrap

    If your theme doesn’t have Bootstrap, these classes exist in name only — they won’t style anything.

    You’d need to either enqueue Bootstrap or write custom CSS in WordPress to mimic them:

        .display-5 { font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 300; }
        .fw-bold { font-weight: 700; }
        .lh-1 { line-height: 1; }
        .mb-3 { margin-bottom: 1rem; }

✅ Summary

    In WordPress, these classes are just additional CSS classes on the <h1> block.

    Effect depends on whether Bootstrap CSS is loaded.

    Best practice: Add them in Block → Advanced → Additional CSS Class(es) for Gutenberg.

If you want, I can show you a ready-to-paste WordPress heading block that has all the Bootstrap classes applied correctly and will work if you enqueue Bootstrap.

How would this translate into wordpress? As in, what wordpress features could i use to achieve this code with this layout?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — this is a classic Bootstrap-based two-column layout with images, headings, and buttons. In WordPress, you don’t have to manually paste all this HTML unless you want full control. You can achieve this using core blocks (Gutenberg) and some Bootstrap classes. Let me break it down:
1. Outer Section (<section id="experts">)

    Use a Group block in Gutenberg.

    Set alignment → Full width.

    Optionally give it a CSS ID in Advanced → HTML anchor → experts.

    Add the background color classes as Additional CSS Classes:

    bg-secondary bg-opacity-10

2. Container

    Inside the Group, add another Group block or Columns block to act as the Bootstrap container.

    Apply classes via Advanced → Additional CSS Class(es):

    container col-xxl-8 px-4 py-5

    The container class centers content and constrains width, just like in Bootstrap.

3. Row

    Use a Columns block:

        2 columns → first for image, second for text.

        To reverse on large screens (flex-lg-row-reverse), you can:

            Add Custom CSS targeting this block
            OR

            Use a Group block with flex direction (if your theme supports it)

    Add the classes:

    row flex-lg-row-reverse align-items-center g-5 py-5

4. Left Column (Image)

    Inside the first column, insert an Image block.

    Set width ~400px (or full width and use max-width in CSS).

    Add class float-none in Advanced → Additional CSS Classes.

5. Right Column (Text)

    Inside the second column:

        Heading block → h1 → Classes: display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3

        Subheading block → h2 → Classes: display-7 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3

        Paragraph block → Classes: lead

        Buttons block → single or multiple buttons

            Add classes: btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 (for Bootstrap styling)

6. Repeat for the next expert

    Add another Group block (or copy the first one) for Kazuma Kiryu.

    Adjust the column order and image/text as in your HTML.

Optional: Using Advanced Layout Plugins

If you want a drag-and-drop approach without worrying about classes, you could use:

    Stackable

    Kadence Blocks

    GenerateBlocks

    These let you build responsive columns, add spacing, and custom backgrounds visually.

7. Important: Make Bootstrap Work in WordPress

    Your classes like bg-secondary, display-5, btn, etc., only work if Bootstrap CSS is loaded.

    Enqueue Bootstrap in your theme (functions.php or via a plugin):

function enqueue_bootstrap() {
    wp_enqueue_style('bootstrap-css', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css');
    wp_enqueue_script('bootstrap-js', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js', array(), null, true);
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_bootstrap');

✅ Summary Mapping
HTML / Bootstrap	WordPress Block Equivalent
<section id="experts">	Group block with HTML anchor experts
.container	Group block inside section, add class container
.row + columns	Columns block (2 columns), add row/flex classes
Image column	Image block, set width, add class float-none
Text column	Heading, Subheading, Paragraph, Buttons blocks, add Bootstrap classes in "Additional CSS Classes"
Buttons	Buttons block, add btn btn-primary btn-lg etc.
flex-lg-row-reverse	Either custom CSS on columns or use a Group block with reversed flex

If you want, I can convert your entire HTML snippet into a ready-to-paste WordPress block code with all the classes preserved and fully responsive — so you can just drop it in Gutenberg.
