## Week 8 - WordPress: Developing Custom Themes

### Learning Activities

In the eighth week of CMS, I spent most of my time developing the assignment 2 website. By this point, we have made all the necessary sites for the content of the page, so the presentation is the last part we need done. For the sites that we could, we made use of posts rather than pages to make it feel a bit more modular. This means that adding more content is done easily just by adding a post rather than editing a page, and the implementation will handle the rest in terms of adding and showing it properly. For example, for promotions, it is as easy as just making a new post, filling in the content of the post, and marking its category as a "Promotion". When looking at the home page, the latest post of a promotion will show up.

We also made a custom theme for our site from scratch, adding a header and footer, as well as giving the general layout and style for all sites. While creating the theme and sites, we used the development tools at our disposal to make sure we worked as efficiently as possible. By using Trello, we could organize and plan our tasks, as well as assign them to the responsible person. Alongside Trello, Slack and Whatsapp have been used to update the team about progress and potential issues.

### Content Insights

Having created a Wordpress theme from scratch, I can see and appreciate the work that goes into creating themes. The advantage of creating your own theme, in contrast to downloading and installing another existing theme, is that it allows for a great amount of customization. 

The tools that we used also made it much easier to see what was left in the way of tasks, and what could potentially be improved upon in existing content.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Themes are just as big a part of any website as the sites themselves, as they give the right customizing touches to give the website its identity. This can be seen on almost any website, which is why I believe themes to be an important thing to learn how to utilize and create. 

Following the customers wishes in terms of the content was also interesting, as we had to figure out the exact implementations from the meeting with the client. Though they specified the content, we had to figure out how to go about actually turning them into sites for the website. This will also be important in the future, as there will most likely be a lot of client interactions in any job when trying to fulfill the requirements.
