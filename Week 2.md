## Week 2: Joomla CMS

### Learning Activities

In the second week of CMS, I spent most of my time learning about Joomla. I learnt that it is a useful and easy-to-use tool for creating CMS's. Setting it up took some time, as it involved setting up XAMPP to run locally, and finding my way around the menus of Joomla was quite challenging.

While Joomla provides a lot of cool and convenient features, it was difficult getting things to look exactly how I wanted it. I eventually learned how to use CSS properly in Joomla and how I could manipulate the HTML code that I specifically wanted to, without getting lost in the whole source code.

### Estimated Hours

Total 8 hours, where 2 hours were spent setting up Joomla locally, 2 hours spent setting up Joomla on a hosted site, and the remaining time spent migrating and cleaning up on the new site.

### Content Insights

Learning Joomla was quite interesting. It made web development quite a bit easier, and at the same time, it was overwhelming with so many different options. For instance, if I wanted to make a menu at the top, I could do so using the "Menus" page in the admins tab. This would get the job done, but if I wanted to change it to fit exactly how I wanted it, I would have to dig into actual HTML code.

I was quite relived to see that I could still code using HTML, as this made migrating my site from the previous practical a breeze.

Learning another web hosting services was also a challenge, but I feel that I have gotten a little wiser and better at it. The process of converting a locally running website to a website that runs on the internet takes more time than I initially thought. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

As I wrote in the previous week's journal, the whole process of creating a website is important, especially in my field as a software engineer. Knowing yet another platform that is used for web development is good, not only because I learn a new skill, but it also improves my ability to learn and grasp new technologies and platforms further.
