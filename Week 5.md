## Week 5: Wordpress Child Themes

### Learning Activities

In the fifth week of CMS, I spent my time primarily on two things. The first was learning how to create child themes in Wordpress. This was done within minutes, as all I had to do was create a new folder in my EC2 instance and give Wordpress the right permissions. The second thing was finishing up and polishing my sites, as they had to be ready, and I wanted to deliver them before the study break. This also meant completing the assignment documentation in the **a1.html** file.

As for making some visible changes to the Wordpress child theme, I changed the color scheme to try and make a "dark mode" for the site. This ended up being a very simple set of changes to the existing CSS. I used the "inspect page" tool on Firefox to make changes to the style of my site before committing these changes to an actual CSS file. This made it much easier to see the changes in real time, as there is a delay between editing a theme's CSS and seeing the change in Wordpress, of about 5-10 minutes.

After all this, I have installed 6 plugins, 3 for Joomla and 3 for Wordpress.

### Estimated Hours

Total 3 hours, where 2 were spent setting up and developing the child theme, and 1 hour was spent finishing up the assignment 1.

### Content Insights

After making the child theme, I realized it would have been a good idea to have done that in the first place. What I mean is, I made changes to the template "twentytwentyfive" as I wanted it to look a very specific way. This resulted in me making changes to the template itself, but this could potentially mean, that an update to the template might undo my changes. However, with a child theme, it would not be affected by an update to the parent template.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Making a child theme is good to know, as it adds yet another layer of customization, one which applies to the site as a whole. It also makes sure, that an update would not affect your site's design, as the update would not touch the child theme.
