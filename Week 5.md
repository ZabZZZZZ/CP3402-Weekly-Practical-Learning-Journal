## Week 5: Wordpress Child Themes

### Learning Activities

In the fifth week of CMS, I spent my time primarily on two things. The first was learning how to create child themes in Wordpress. This was done within minutes, as all I had to do was create a new folder in my EC2 instance and give Wordpress the right permissions. The second thing was finishing up and polishing my sites, as they had to be ready, and I wanted to deliver them before the study break. This also meant completing the assignment documentation in the **a1.html** file.

After all this, I have installed 6 plugins, 3 for Joomla and 3 for Wordpress.

### Content Insights

Adding more content to my sites was quite easy. I have spent a good amount of time learning the two platforms, so I knew my way around them, as well as how to deal with the quirks of each platform. For example, some things that just worked as HTML in Joomla did not work the same in Wordpress, so I had to use certain "blocks" provided by Wordpress to make it look similar.

Making a local development environment was one of the major parts that I spent time with this week. This part was not too painful for Joomla, as there is a plugin that makes this easy. There was only one problem, and it was due to how I first set up Joomla locally, then moved it to a cloud server for hosting, by just copy/pasting the files. This resulted in two directories that should not have been there, but the problem was solved by simply just deleting them from the server.

After making a local development environment for Joomla, I proceeded to do the same for Wordpress. Again, there was a plugin that made this extremely easy, the only part that took any time was making a local Wordpress site before importing the site from the cloud.

The plugins used for each site is an equivalent of each other. For example, I used a plugin to make a contact form for the contact us page on both Joomla and Wordpress. This makes it very easy to leave some tedious parts to the plugins, while I can focus on the content of the sites, as well as the design.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

When setting up the local development environment for Joomla and Wordpress, I used an application called XAMPP. It contains multiple applications in one, but the most important were Apache, PhpMyAdmin, and MariaDB. These were important in setting up the sites locally, and I could use just one XAMPP application to host both of my sites locally. I also went a step further, and gave custom domains to my local sites, which not only makes it easier to get to the websites, it also feels really cool.

I believe, that having a development pipeline is necessary to having a smooth development cycle. Going from making changes to the local environment, to pushing them to production is one thing that happens in almost every company, so knowing how to set up the local development environment will definitely be important in a career context.
