## Week 1: Subject Intro and Web Design Basics

### Learning Activities

In the first week of CP3402, I focused on learning and trying to figure out how to publish a website through Github Pages. I focused on learning how to create a simple static website, without much regard for the content. 

I have some prior experience with creating a website using Next.js, so I applied that knowledge here when setting up the website on Github Pages. I had to learn, through a friend of mine, how to set up a Next.js project, and I used GenAI to help guide me through the process of building and deploying my website to Github Pages.

This was my first experience using the Bootstrap examples, from which I created most of the components of the website. I learned how to modify and manipulate the code for my own purposes, especially the various CSS options.

### Estimated Hours

7 hours

### Content Insights

Re-learning and re-applying my prior knowledge in web development was quite fun. I struggled when it came to deploying the site to Github Pages, but in the end, I learned how to do it. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Making, building and deploying websites are important things to know how to do. I believe this knowledge will help me in the future in various fields of employment. No matter what the topic, subject or field I will find myself in, knowing how to create a website, from the start of a project to the deployment of a site, will be important.
