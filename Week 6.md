## Week 6: Project/client introduction, group project management

### Learning Activities

In the sixth week of CMS, I spent my time getting acquainted with the rest of my team for the assignment 2, which is a group project. However, half of my team did not show up, so I ended up only getting acquainted with one of my team members. Still, we managed to get the project started. I learned about Slack, a tool which is useful for integrating project management with communication between team members.

### Estimated Hours

Around 4 hours, where I spent 3 hours getting acquainted and setting up tools, and 1 hour spent writing the journal.

### Content Insights

We managed to integrate Github and Trello with Slack, which I can see being very handy. When there is a new commit, the Github App informs of the commit in the channel, with the name and author of the commit. This is very nice, as I can see who and what is being committed all in one place. The Trello integration also allows for making new cards through Slack.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

As I have seen Slack be used in a professional space, I can see it being useful to know and learn in the future. The same can be said for Trello, which I did not use in the first half of CMS, but with a project that involves multiple people and a lot of moving parts, I am relieved that we will use it for task management during the project.
